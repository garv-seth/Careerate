You are tasked with building Careerate—a next-generation, agentic DevOps & hosting platform that far outclasses Starsling and Monk.io.
you have this contextual summary of its capabilities to guide you:

Context Summary
• Backend API (Node.js/TypeScript) under apps/api/
– Orchestrator modules: agents.ts, llm.ts, state.ts, observability-agent.ts, workflow-import.ts, workflow.ts
– Routers for projects, users, workflows
– Tool integrations in tools/ (AWS, Azure, Terraform, Kubernetes, Jenkins, CircleCI, Datadog, Snyk, etc.)
– Data layer: Prisma + CosmosDB (db.ts, cosmosdb.ts)
– Auth via Passport in auth/passport.ts
• Frontend UI (Next.js + TypeScript) under apps/web/
– Dynamic workflow graph editor, chat panel, message bubbles, Glass UI components, Mermaid integration
– Auth provider, MSAL config, global layout, Tailwind CSS
– State management via a Redux-like store and deployment utilities
• Monorepo extras: shared UI library, agent packages, types, utilities

Use this summary to reference existing features—but do not assume file-level access or modify the repo. Instead, design Careerate from the ground up around these nine pillars:

Autonomous Multi-Agent Core
• Leverage Google ADK + the Google A2A protocol for secure, high-throughput inter-agent messaging.
• Embed LangChain (or LangGraph, Griptape) for prompt orchestration, memory, dynamic tool chaining.
• Define a registry of agents (planner, builder, tester, deployer, monitor) that negotiate tasks via A2A:

// AgentRegistry pseudo-module
registerAgent("planner",  ["analyze-repo","generate-plan"]);
registerAgent("builder",  ["render-templates","compile-assets"]);
registerAgent("deployer", ["k8s-deploy","serverless-deploy"]);
registerAgent("monitor",  ["health-check","auto-heal"]);

// A2A handshake flow
planner → builder: {
  taskId: 101,
  infraSpec: { aws: ["vpc","ecs"], gcp: ["gke","cloud-run"] },
  codeRef: "git@repo:main"
}
builder → deployer: {
  taskId: 101,
  artifacts: ["docker:api:101","helm:charts/web"]
}
deployer → monitor: {
  taskId: 101,
  endpoints: ["https://app.careerate.ai"]
}

Comprehensive Auth Workflows
• Azure AD B2C / AAD (single-tenant & multi-tenant) via MSAL, OIDC, refresh tokens.
• Firebase Auth (Google, Apple, Email link) for mobile/app clients.
• GitHub & GitLab OAuth for repo-based permissions and webhooks.
• Gmail API integration for transactional emails and calendar invites.

// Example Azure OIDC config
export const azureConfig: OIDCConfig = {
  tenantId:   process.env.AZURE_TENANT_ID!,
  clientId:   process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_ID!,
  clientSecret: process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET!,
  redirectUri:  `${APP_URL}/api/auth/callback/azure`,
  scopes:     ["openid","profile","email","offline_access"],
};

Competitor Analysis & Differentiation
• Starsling: strong event-driven pipelines but limited multi-cloud IaC.
• Monk.lio: ephemeral dev workspaces yet basic agent orchestration.
Careerate must fuse ephemeral developer enclaves, real-time observability, and enterprise-grade, multi-cloud IaC with secure rollbacks and self-healing.

Multi-Cloud Infrastructure & Best Practices
• AWS: CDK modules for VPC, ECS/EKS, Lambda; IAM least privilege; SSM Parameter Store.
• GCP: Terraform modules for VPC, GKE, Cloud Run; Workload Identity; Secret Manager.
• Provide an abstraction layer so users choose Terraform, CloudFormation, or CDK.

infrastructure:
  aws:
    modules:
      - "git::https://github.com/careerate-templates/aws-vpc.git"
      - "git::https://github.com/careerate-templates/aws-eks.git"
  gcp:
    modules:
      - "git::https://github.com/careerate-templates/gcp-network.git"
      - "git::https://github.com/careerate-templates/gcp-gke.git"

Agent Prompting & Orchestration Best Practices
• Dynamic system messages describing domain context (e.g., “You are the builder reading orchestrator/agents.ts and WorkflowEditor.tsx”).
• Chain-of-thought + inner monologue to improve plan clarity.
• Provide few-shot examples for rollback, secret rotation, security audits.

Liquid-Glass-Inspired UI
• Adopt “glassmorphism”: layered translucency, soft shadows, fluid blur behind components.
• Build a React/Tailwind component library with a <GlassPanel> that uses CSS backdrop-filter.
• Support real-time, collaborative graph editing for workflows.

// GlassPanel.tsx
export function GlassPanel({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="backdrop-blur-lg bg-white/20 rounded-2xl p-8 shadow-xl">
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

Vibe-Hosting & Agent-Powered Runtime
• One-click “agent-powered hosting”: agents build container images, provision serverless functions or VMs, configure TLS/CDN, and manage autoscaling.
• Self-healing via health probes → agent-triggered rollbacks or redeploys.
• GitOps: desired state stored in Git; agents reconcile continuously.

Integration Matrix
• Firebase: Firestore for state, Functions for lightweight agents.
• GitHub: Webhooks → agents; accelerate CI/CD via custom GitHub Actions.
• Gmail API: automated status emails, meeting scheduling.
• LangChain: Redis/PG memory backends, vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate), dynamic tool registry.
• Monitoring: Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana agents embedded in platform.

Autonomous Hosting, Maintenance & Cost Optimization
• Health checks → auto-scale, auto-heal, agent-triggered rollbacks.
• Cost audits: agent reviews cloud spend, suggests rightsizing & reserved instances.
• Billing dashboards integrated into UI for indie devs and enterprises.

Deliverables:
• A high-level architecture diagram and component breakdown.
• Detailed pseudocode scaffolding for core services (agent registry, A2A messaging, auth modules, IaC templates).
• Sample config snippets (Azure, GCP, AWS, LangChain).
• UI component prototypes illustrating Liquid-Glass design.
• A roadmap showing how all pieces—Google ADK/A2A, LangChain, multi-cloud IaC, autonomous hosting—form a cohesive, premium DevOps/hosting platform.
